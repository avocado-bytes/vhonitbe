# Changelog

## 0.3.0

- Load and analyze the elevation data for the shooting safety overlay in a web worker, so the map stays responsive.
- Show a loading overlay on the map while the elevation data is loaded and analyzed.
- Cache map and elevation tiles for offline use for up to a year (up to 10,000 map tiles and 500 elevation tiles).

## 0.2.0

- Add a shooting safety overlay to the map (first version). When enabled, elevation data around the user is loaded and the map is shaded green where the terrain stops a bullet shortly behind the target and red where it doesn't.

## 0.1.0

- Show the application version in the settings menu.
